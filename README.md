### [Persona 5 Royal Guide](Persona5RoyalGuide/index.html)

I wanted an elegant guide styled after the game to occupy my second screen while playing. Other guides would require you to keep track of the day you were up to by scrolling through difficult to read whole pages of text, require you to switch tabs for negotiations and part time quizes.

- [x] Includes [Recipe Browser](MealPlanner/RecipeBrowser.html) - for if you want to search for a recipe instead of being assigned.


### [Idle Landlord](IdleLandlord/IdleLandlord.html)

I've wanted to make a clicker game for a while. The king of passive income is landlording, so I really wanted to make landlord themed clicker game. Features:

- [x] Work a job and get promoted
- [x] 7 properties you can buy
- [x] Upgrade Properties to earn more
- [x] Auto-save and manual saving to cookies
- [x] Importing/Exporting saves to JSON

- [x] 16 different stories
- [x] Page design to match the mood of the story
- [x] Complete the story by filling in the missing words
- [x] Watch as the story unfolds keystroke at a time accompanied by 7 different musical tracks
- [x] Adjustable Text-speed and audio fade
- [x] support for making and importing custom stories via the [Story Maker](StoryTeller/StoryMaker.html)


### [Manticore Generator](ManticoreGenerator/ManticoreGenerator.html)

A friend of mine saw the character generator and was working on creating some manticores for a personal project. They asked if I could make something similar to assist them in the process. I added a few extra features to help them:

- [x] Random chance of not adding a tail/wings
- [x] Settings to decide the chance of tail/wings
- [x] Ability to lock body parts to prevent randomization
- [x] 461 Animals!
- [x] Click the name of an animal to be redirected to Bing images in a new tab!

Otherwise, it is very similar to the Character Generator.


### [Character Generator](CharacterGenerator/CharacterGenerator.html)

I was familiar with name generators, but I wanted to put my own spin on it by adding a few extra features.

- [x] Names composed of different syllables
- [x] Demographic details about the character
- [x] A stat list for each character

The characters may come out as a bit whimsical, but I found it enjoyable.


### [Percentage Clock](PercentageClock/PercentageClock.html)

On challenging days, it's helpful to know how much of the day is left. Percentage Clock provides this information in a simple number. It might not offer much comfort as I got a bit carried away with the CSS animation library. A few features include:

- [x] Indicates the current time
- [x] Transitions from red to green throughout the day
- [x] Pulses like your heart
- [x] You can press on the number, and it produces an annoying noise that increases in pitch, creating a sense of unease

Wouldn't particularly recommend this one.


### [Word Scrambler](WordScrambler/WordScrambler.html)

I created this a while ago to replicate a peculiar mode of speech I was exposed to. I just need to port it over. Features:

- [x] Scrambles input text into a semi-comprehensible mess



## Incomplete Projects

### [The Great Hundred Man Fight](TheGreatHundredManFight/TheGreatHundredManFight.html)

### [Pet Game](PetGame/PetGame.html)

PLAYABLE DEMO. A digimon/tamogotchi clone with my own spin.
