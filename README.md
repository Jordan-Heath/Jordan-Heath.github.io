## Completed Projects <a name="complete"></a>

### [Cyber Omniglot](CyberOmniglot/) <a name="cyber-omniglot"></a>
Inspired by the "Morrowind" coversation system, and puzzle games like "The Rise of the Golden Idol". I wanted to make a refined yet classic looking conversation puzzle game. I settled on a limited number of characters, simple translation puzzle, as the immense writing task overtook the coding practice the game was supposed to be.

- [x] Text to Speech
- [x] Retro UI
- [x] Simple Translation Puzzle
- [x] 5 unique characters
- [x] 80 lines of dialogue
- [x] 9 Words to Translate
- [x] Once a word is given a translation, it is replaced in game.


### [Strategy Map Simulator](StrategyMapSimulator/) <a name="strategy-map-simulator"></a>
Inspired by Paradox Interactive games like "Victoria 3" and "Hearts of Iron IV". I wanted to experiment with a complicated canvas based game. The UI was placeholder and then I lost interest.

- [x] Procedurally generated landmass
- [x] Map Editor
- [x] Complicated kingdom AI


### [Persona 3 Reload Guide](Persona3ReloadGuide/) <a name="persona-3-reload-guide"></a>

- [x] Notepad for saving notes
- [x] Notepad for highlighing text in the guide
- [x] Link to Fusion Calculator
- [x] Press numpad +/- to go to next/prev day
- [x] Personalised graphic design to match Persona 3


### [Tamagotchi Uni Guide](TamagotchiUniGuide/) <a name="tamagotchi-uni-guide"></a>
A webapp I put together for my partner to help them keep track of their Tamagotchi Uni. It was important that it had a nice mobile-friendly design, kept track of progress in the game, and informed the user in a very accessible way.

- [x] Mobile Friendly
- [x] Tamagotchi inspired design
- [x] Saves progress / settings to local storage
- [x] Completion Stats
- [x] Evolution Chart
- [x] Completion Diary

- [x] Likes & Dislikes
- [x] Pets
- [x] Care Icons


### [Qualification Academy](QualificationAcademy/) <a name="qualification-academy"></a>
A game where you complete a series of questions to receive a certificate. I wanted it to be elegant and fun.

- [x] Custom Courses
- [x] Elegant UI Design
- [x] Sound effects
- [x] Mobile Friendly
- [x] Dark Mode
- [x] Saving to local storage
- [x] Importing/Exporting courses to JSON


### [Pokemon Collector](CustomChess/) <a name="pokemon-collector"></a>
I've wanted to make a card collection game for a while, but given I could not do enough good quality art to do it myself, i decided last minute to make it a fan game.

- [x] 6 CardPacks to unlock pokemon
- [x] 151 Pokemon to collect/evolve
- [x] 151 Shiny Pokemon with a base 0.1% shiny rate
- [x] 16 Upgrades to unlock

- [x] Cheat mode - provides a CardPack with busted odds and money rewards
- [x] Optimised Card rendering


### [Custom Chess](CustomChess/) <a name="custom-chess"></a>
Inspired by Balatro, but for chess. Work In Progress, but good enough to publish.

- [x] Saving
- [x] All pieces working
- [x] Reckless AI
- [x] Build a streak to earn greater prizes
- [x] Carry your pieces over to the next round


### [Persona 5 Royal Guide](Persona5RoyalGuide/) <a name="persona-5-royal-guide"></a>
I wanted an elegant guide styled after the game to occupy my second screen while playing. Other guides would require you to keep track of the day you were up to by scrolling through difficult to read whole pages of text, require you to switch tabs for negotiations and part time quizes.

- [x] Full 300 days of day by day guidance
- [x] Guide for selecting Flowers
- [x] Guide for finding barcodes in convenience store
- [x] Guide for confidants

### [The Collector](TheCollector/) <a name="the-collector"></a>
Idle Collection game. To my knowledge the first of it's kind.

- [x] Includes [Recipe Maker](MealPlanner/RecipeMaker.html) - a tool for making the json recipes the app uses.
- [x] Includes [Recipe Browser](MealPlanner/RecipeBrowser.html) - for if you want to search for a recipe instead of being assigned.


### [Idle Landlord](IdleLandlord/) <a name="idle-landlord"></a>
I've wanted to make a clicker game for a while. The king of passive income is landlording, so I really wanted to make landlord themed clicker game. Features:

- [x] Work a job and get promoted
- [x] 7 properties you can buy
- [x] Upgrade Properties to earn more
- [x] Auto-save and manual saving to cookies
- [x] Importing/Exporting saves to JSON
- [x] Unique mobile layout


### [Story Teller](StoryTeller/) <a name="story-teller"></a>
I developed an app that emulates the game Madlibs. Features:

- [x] 16 different stories
- [x] Page design to match the mood of the story
- [x] Complete the story by filling in the missing words
- [x] Watch as the story unfolds keystroke at a time accompanied by 7 different musical tracks
- [x] Adjustable Text-speed and audio fade
- [x] support for making and importing custom stories via the [Story Maker](StoryTeller/StoryMaker.html)


### [Manticore Generator](ManticoreGenerator/) <a name="manticore-generator"></a>
A friend of mine saw the character generator and was working on creating some manticores for a personal project. They asked if I could make something similar to assist them in the process. I added a few extra features to help them:

- [x] Random chance of not adding a tail/wings
- [x] Settings to decide the chance of tail/wings
- [x] Ability to lock body parts to prevent randomization
- [x] 461 Animals!
- [x] Click the name of an animal to be redirected to Bing images in a new tab!

Otherwise, it is very similar to the Character Generator.


### [Character Generator](CharacterGenerator/) <a name="character-generator"></a>
I was familiar with name generators, but I wanted to put my own spin on it by adding a few extra features.

- [x] Names composed of different syllables
- [x] Demographic details about the character
- [x] A stat list for each character

The characters may come out as a bit whimsical, but I found it enjoyable.


### [Percentage Clock](PercentageClock/) <a name="percentage-clock"></a>
On challenging days, it's helpful to know how much of the day is left. Percentage Clock provides this information in a simple number. It might not offer much comfort as I got a bit carried away with the CSS animation library. A few features include:

- [x] Indicates the current time
- [x] Transitions from red to green throughout the day
- [x] Pulses like your heart
- [x] You can press on the number, and it produces an annoying noise that increases in pitch, creating a sense of unease

Wouldn't particularly recommend this one.


### [Word Scrambler](WordScrambler/) <a name="word-scrambler"></a>
I created this a while ago to replicate a peculiar mode of speech I was exposed to. I just need to port it over. Features:

- [x] Scrambles input text into a semi-comprehensible mess
