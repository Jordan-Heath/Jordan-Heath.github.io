![Ants](thumbnails/Ants.png "Ants")
I was looking to make a wallpaper and was inspired by the classic DVD screensaver. I wanted to add a little more flare so I chose to make it ants and have them pivot direction.

- [x] Seemingly limitless ants
- [x] They bounce off the walls
- [x] They're clever enough to face where they are going I guess

### [CoughTTS](https://jordan-heath.github.io/CoughTTS/) <a name="coughtts"></a>

![Game Guide Checklist](thumbnails/GameGuideChecklist.png "Game Guide Checklist")
Convert a game guide into a checklist to help you remember all the things you need to know. I was sick of paywalling of checklisting as a feature. I also wanted a darkmode second screen guide. I made this a couple years ago as a pyflask server, but converted it to a static webapp.

Inspired by the "Morrowind" coversation system, and puzzle games like "The Rise of the Golden Idol". I wanted to make a refined yet classic looking conversation puzzle game. I settled on a limited number of characters, simple translation puzzle, as the immense writing task overtook the coding practice the game was supposed to be.

- [x] Simple translation puzzle
- [x] 5 unique characters
- [x] 80 lines of dialogue

- [x] Drawing tools
- [x] Bad UI
