## Completed Projects <a name="complete"></a>

### [Game Guide Checklist](GameGuideChecklist/) <a name="game-guide-checklist"></a>
![Game Guide Checklist](data/thumbnails/GameGuideChecklist.png "Game Guide Checklist")
Convert a game guide into a checklist to help you remember all the things you need to know. I was sick of paywalling of checklisting as a feature. I also wanted a darkmode second screen guide. I made this a couple years ago as a pyflask server, but converted it to a static webapp.

- [x] Light polish

![Cyber Omniglot](data/thumbnails/CyberOmniglot.png "Cyber Omniglot")
Inspired by the "Morrowind" coversation system, and puzzle games like "The Rise of the Golden Idol". I wanted to make a refined yet classic looking conversation puzzle game. I settled on a limited number of characters, simple translation puzzle, as the immense writing task overtook the coding practice the game was supposed to be.

- [x] Text to Speech
- [x] Retro UI
- [x] Simple translation puzzle
- [x] 5 unique characters
- [x] 80 lines of dialogue
- [x] 9 words to translate

![Strategy Map Simulator](data/thumbnails/StrategyMapSimulator.png "Strategy Map Simulator")

- [x] Drawing tools
- [x] Bad UI

### [Persona 3 Reload Guide](Persona3ReloadGuide/) <a name="persona-3-reload-guide"></a>

- [x] Persona-themed design

### [Tamagotchi Uni Guide](TamagotchiUniGuide/) <a name="tamagotchi-uni-guide"></a>
![Tamagotchi Uni Guide](data/thumbnails/TamagotchiUniGuide.png "Tamagotchi Uni Guide")
A webapp I put together for my partner to help them keep track of their Tamagotchi Uni. It was important that it had a nice mobile-friendly design, kept track of progress in the game, and informed the user in a very accessible way.

- [x] Mobile friendly
- [x] Local storage saves
- [x] Completion stats
- [x] Evolution chart
- [x] DLC support

![Persona 5 Royal Guide](data/thumbnails/Persona5RoyalGuide.png "Persona 5 Royal Guide")
I wanted an elegant guide styled after the game to occupy my second screen while playing. Other guides would require you to keep track of the day you were up to by scrolling through difficult to read whole pages of text, require you to switch tabs for negotiations and part time quizes.
